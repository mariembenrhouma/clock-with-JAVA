Activity 1: Clock

1. Use the ClockPane class to write a program that displays two clocks. The hour, minute, 
and second values are 4, 20, 45 for the first clock and 22, 46, 15 for the second clock, as 
shown in the following figure.

2. Modify the ClockPane class with three new Boolean properties
- hourHandVisible
- minuteHandVisible
- secondHandVisible
and their associated accessor and mutator methods. 
You can use the set methods to make a hand visible or invisible.

3. Write a test program that displays only the hour and minute hands. The hour and 
minute values are randomly generated. The hour is between 0 and 11, and the minute 
is either 0 or 30, as shown in the figure below

4. Modify ClockPane.java, to add the animation into this class and add two methods start() 
and stop() to start and stop the clock.

5. Write a program that lets the user control the clock with the Start and Stop buttons, as 
shown in the figure.
